# ðŸ“‘ Is this package for me?

**VIMuRe** is a package for fitting latent network models to multiply-sampled social network data.  ^[<mark class="todo">**\#TODO**</mark>: Explain what multiply-sampled social network data is.]

ðŸ“¦ There is one implementation in R and one in Python. The R implementation is a wrapper around the Python implementation. Both packages are in active development and are not yet on CRAN or PyPI. Use the installation instructions below to install the latest development version.

Here is what you can expect from this package:

- **Input:** multiply-sampled social network data as a list of adjacency matrices or igraph objects. ^[<mark class="todo">**\#TODO**</mark>: Illustrate what this means.]

- **Output:** a fitted latent network model that can be used to obtain samples or a point-estimate network (an igraph object) from the posterior distribution of the fitted model. ^[<mark class="todo">**\#TODO**</mark>: Illustrate what this means.]
