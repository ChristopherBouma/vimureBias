## Development Setup

### Quarto documentation

The documentation is written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). To install Quarto, follow the instructions on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html). Ideally, use VSCode with the [Quarto extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto-dev.quarto-vscode) for a better experience.

After cloning the repository, cd to `docs/` and run `quarto preview . --render all --no-browser` to render the documentation locally. Take a look at the YAML file to understand the structure of the documentation.
