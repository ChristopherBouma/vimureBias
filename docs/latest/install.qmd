VIMuRe is available in both R and Python. The R implementation is a wrapper around the Python implementation. Both packages are in active development and are not yet on CRAN or PyPI. Use the installation instructions below to install the latest development version.

## ðŸ“¢ Note

If your preferred language is R, we would like to hear from you. Please add a message [to this discussion](https://github.com/latentnetworks/vimure/discussions/66) to tell us whether you would like to see an easier installation process for R.

## Step 01: Install `reticulate`

Open your R console and type the following command:

```r
install.packages("reticulate")
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Why do I need this package?

- Our core code is written in python, so we use `reticulate` to integrate our model in R. This package allows you to use Python within your R session in a seamless, high-performance interoperable way. 

- `reticulate` will look for the python installed on your computer. If for some reason it cannot find it, you may be prompted to download and install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). 

    - [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is the recommended installation method for most users, as it is easier to ensure that the newly installed python is isolated from other python installs you have in your system. 

    - If you initially declined the [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installation prompt, you can later manually install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) by running `reticulate::install_miniconda()`.

## Step 02: Install the latest `vimure` (v0.1)

In your R console, type the following commands:

```r
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("latentnetworks/vimure", subdir="src/R", ref="main")
```

Check out [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) package documentation if you are not familiar with it.

## Step 03: Install the Python package 

You **must** install the python package before using the R package. This is because the R package is a wrapper around the Python package. You can do this without leaving R, though. Just type the following command in your R console:

```r
require(vimure)
vimure::install_vimure()
```

If you are not using RStudio, i.e., you are using R in the terminal, you may need to restart your R session after installing the Python package.

### Step 04: Check the installation

To confirm that the installation was successful, run the following command:

```r
library(vimure)
vimure::vm_config()
```

You should see something like the following:

```r
#> Loaded vimure version
#> Vimure v (...)
#> Python v3.x (...)
```

</details>


# Python

`vimure` is not yet available on PyPI, so to install the latest development version, follow the instructions below.

Install the latest `vimure` (v0.1) with the following command:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/latentnetworks/vimure.git#egg=vimure&subdirectory=src/python/"
```

This Python package was tested on Python >= 3.8, and it is expected to work fine in all OSes.
