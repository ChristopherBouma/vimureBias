VIMuRe is available in both R and Python. The R implementation is a wrapper around the Python implementation. Both packages are in active development and are not yet on CRAN or PyPI. Use the installation instructions below to install the latest development version.


Choose your language:


::: panel-tabset

# R

`vimure` is not yet available on CRAN, but you can still it with [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/).


Install the latest `vimure` (v0.1.3) with the following command:

```r
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("latentnetworks/vimure", subdir="src/R", ref="v0.1.3")
```

To confirm that the installation was successful, run the following command:

```r
library(vimure)
vimure::vm_config()
```

You should see something like the following:

```text
Python version: v3.9 (~/Library/r-miniconda-arm64/envs/r-vimure/bin/python)
Python version of vimure: 0.1.3
```

Underneath it all, our R package runs on [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/), which is a package that allows R to interface with Python. The `vm_config()` function above shows you the Python version that is being used by `vimure`. We took the executive decision to manage the Python installation for you, so you don't have to worry about it and so that it doesn't clash with your existing Python installation. 

# Python

`vimure` is not yet available on PyPI, so to install the latest development version, follow the instructions below.

Install the latest `vimure` (v0.1.3) with the following command:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/latentnetworks/vimure.git#egg=vimure&subdirectory=src/python/"
```

This Python package was tested on Python >= 3.8, and it is expected to work fine in all major OSes (Windows, Mac, Ubuntu).
