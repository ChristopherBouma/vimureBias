# Introduction

Before you start using `VIMuRe`, you need to prepare your data in a specific format. This tutorial will show you how to do that. 

Here, we will illustrate the process of preparing data for the `VIMuRe` package using the **"Data on Social Networks and Microfinance in Indian Villages"** dataset [@banerjee_diffusion_2013]. This dataset contains network data on 75 villages in the Karnataka state of India. 

**⚙️ Setup**

We will rely on the following packages in this tutorial:

```r
library(tidyverse)
```

This will automatically load:

- [the pipe `%>%`](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html)
- the `haven` package, which we will use to read the data that is stored in the Stata DTA format
- the `dplyr` package, which we will use to recode and select variables and for things like `mutate()`, `if_else()`
- the `tidyr` package, which we will use to reshape the data

# Step 1: Download edgelist

Follow the steps below to download the data.

1. Click on [this link](https://www.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/IndianVillagesDataFiles.zip)  to download the dataset from Prof. [Matthew O. Jackson's website](https://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/) [^1]. This will download a file called `IndianVillagesDataFiles.zip` in your working directory.
2. Unzip the file. This will create a folder called `2010-0760_Data` in your working directory.
💡 Tip: you can use the `unzip()` function from within R to unzip the file.

The folder structure should look like this:

![](/figures/tutorials/jackson_download_zipfile.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of how folder structure should look like."}

The data we need is within that `Data/Raw_csv/` folder, and look like this:

![](/figures/tutorials/karnataka_raw_csvs.png)


# Step 2: Collect individual-level metadata

We also need individual-level information metadata. This data is available on a separate source, the Harvard Dataverse [@banerjee_diffusion_2013-1].

1. Go to [https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=2460959&version=9.4](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=2460959&version=9.4), read and accept the "License/Data Use Agreement" to gain access to the data. We are using version 9.4 of the dataset.
2. Click on the "Access File" button, then "Download | ZIP Archive" to download the data.

> ![](/figures/tutorials/dataverse_harvard_download_zipfile.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of how to download data from Harvard Dataverse."}

3. Unzip the file. This will create a folder called `datav4.0.zip` in your working directory.

The data we need is within that `datav4.0/Data/2. Demographics and Outcomes/` folder.

4. Read the data into R using the `read_dta()` function from the `haven` package:

```r
# Read Stata DTA files
indivinfo <- haven::read_dta("datav4.0/Data/2. Demographics and Outcomes/individual_characteristics.dta")
indivinfo <- indivinfo[!duplicated(indivinfo$pid)==TRUE,] ## one individual (6109803) is repeated twice.
```

5. Ensure that the `pid` is a character vector:

```r
indivinfo$pid <- as.character(indivinfo$pid)
```

# Step 3: Build an edge list per village

We will now build the edge list for each village. We will illustrate the process for village 1, but if you scroll down you will find the full script for all villages.

## 3.1. Read metadata

Let's first subset the individual-level metadata to keep only the relevant village:

```r
# Keep track of where the edgelist files are stored
RAW_CSV_FOLDER <- "2010-0760_Data/Data/Raw_csv"

# Let's focus on just one village for now
selected_village <- 1

# Filter the individual-level metadata to keep only the relevant village
resp <- subset(indivinfo, indivinfo$village == selected_village)
resp$didsurv <- 1
```

::: callout-note

The `didsurv` column is a dummy variable that indicates whether the individual participated in the survey. We will need this information later to tell our  Bayesian model who participated in the survey.

:::

## 3.2. Read village data

Now, let's read the `village_1.csv` file and merge it with the individual-level metadata:

```r
village_file <- file.path(RAW_CSV_FOLDER, paste("village", selected_village, ".csv", sep = ""))
indiv <- read.csv(village_file, header = FALSE, as.is = TRUE)
colnames(indiv) <- c("hhid", "ppid", "gender", "age")

## gender (1-Male, 2-Female)
indiv$gender <- dplyr::recode(indiv$gender, "Male", "Female")

## pre-process pid to match the format in the individual-level metadata
indiv$pid <- ifelse(nchar(indiv$ppid)==2, paste(indiv$hhid, indiv$ppid, sep = ""),
                    paste(indiv$hhid, 0, indiv$ppid, sep = ""))

## Select only the relevant columns
selected_cols <- c("pid", "resp_status", "religion", "caste", "didsurv") 
indiv <- merge(indiv, resp[,selected_cols], by = "pid", all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE) 
```

Which produces a dataframe that looks like this:

```r
head(indiv)
```

|pid    | hhid| ppid|gender | age| resp_status| religion| caste| didsurv|
|:------|----:|----:|:------|---:|-----------:|--------:|-----:|-------:|
|100101 | 1001|    1|Male   |  75|          NA|       NA|    NA|      NA|
|100102 | 1001|    2|Female |  55|          NA|       NA|    NA|      NA|
|100103 | 1001|    3|Male   |  24|          NA|       NA|    NA|      NA|
|100104 | 1001|    4|Female |  19|          NA|       NA|    NA|      NA|
|100201 | 1002|    1|Male   |  38|           1|        1|     3|       1|
|100202 | 1002|    2|Female |  27|           2|        1|     3|       1|

## 3.3 Read reports per relationship type

The survey that produced this data collected information on a number of different types of relationships, four of which were "double sampled" (i.e., asked about in two ways, who people **go** to for that type of support, and who **comes** to them). Specifically, they asked about borrowing and receiving money, giving and receiving advice, borrowing and lending household items like kerosene and rice, and visiting and receiving guests. These distinct questions are represented in the data files with the following names:

- lendmoney,
- borrowmoney,
- giveadvice,
- helpdecision,
- keroricecome,
- keroricego,
- visitcome
- visitgo

Each of these relationships is stored in a separate file. For example, the file `lendmoney1.csv` contains information on who reported lending money to whom in village 1.

We can read each of these files using the `read.csv()` function. For example:

```r
filepath_lendmoney <- file.path(RAW_CSV_FOLDER, paste("lendmoney", selected_village, ".csv", sep=""))
lendmoney <- read.csv(filepath_lendmoney, header = FALSE, as.is = TRUE, na = ALL_NA_CODES)
```

The `ALL_NA_CODES` variable is a vector of all the codes that, after inspection, we identified were used to represent missing values in the data:

```r
ALL_NA_CODES <- c("9999999", "5555555", "7777777", "0")
```

**What the data look like**

The data is stored here as a node list, but it will need to be further pre-processed as an edge list:

::: {style="width:60%;"}

|     V1|     V2|     V3| V4|V5 |V6 |V7 |V8 |V9 |
|------:|------:|------:|--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 100201| 107603|     NA| NA|NA |NA |NA |NA |NA |
| 100202| 102902|     NA| NA|NA |NA |NA |NA |NA |
| 100601| 101901| 102601| NA|NA |NA |NA |NA |NA |
| 100602| 100501| 101902| NA|NA |NA |NA |NA |NA |
| 100701| 100801| 102101| NA|NA |NA |NA |NA |NA |
| 100702| 100801| 104001| NA|NA |NA |NA |NA |NA |

:::

Each row represents reports made by a single individual; the first number is the `pid` (the "person identifier") of the individual who reported the relationship, whereas the remaining however many numbers listed in the same row are the `pid`s of the individuals who were reported to be involved in the relationship.

## 3.4. Pre-process the data to build the edge list

We want the network data to be in the following format, plus a few additional columns:

::: {style="width:20%;"}

|   ego | alter |
|------:|------:|
| 100201| 107603|
| 100202| 100201|
| 100601| 101901|
| 100601| 102601|
| 100601| 115501|
| 100602| 100501|
| 100602| 101902|
| 100701| 100801|
| 100701| 102101|
| 100702| 100801|

:::

To achieve this, we will need to [pivot](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html) the data.

```r
tie_type <- "lendmoney"

# Example with the lendmoney data
edgelist_lendmoney <- tidyr::pivot_longer(lendmoney, cols=!V1, values_drop_na=TRUE)

# View(edgelist_lendmoney) to see what the data look like
```

This produces a bogus `name` column, which we can drop. We should also rename the columns to something more meaningful. It is **important** that we add a `respondent` column. This will be the `pid` of the individual who reported the relationship.


```r
edgelist_lendmoney <- edgelist_lendmoney %>% 
    dplyr::select(-name) %>% 
    rename(ego=V1, alter=value) %>% 
    mutate(reporter=ego)

# Let's also add a column for the tie type
edgelist_lendmoney$tie_type <- tie_type

# Let's add a weight column too
edgelist_lendmoney$weight <- 1
```

producing `head(edgelist_lendmoney)`:

::: {style="width:50%;"}
 

|    ego|  alter| reporter|tie_type  | weight|
|------:|------:|--------:|:---------|------:|
| 100201| 107603|   100201|lendmoney |      1|
| 100202| 102902|   100202|lendmoney |      1|
| 100601| 101901|   100601|lendmoney |      1|
| 100601| 102601|   100601|lendmoney |      1|
| 100602| 100501|   100602|lendmoney |      1|
| 100602| 101902|   100602|lendmoney |      1|

:::

So far, we only added `tie_type = "lendmoney"` to the data frame, but to make full use of VIMuRe, we also need to add the "flipped question" to the data frame, which in this case is `tie_type = "borrowmoney"`. This is because the survey asked two different questions about borrowing and receiving money. **The process is the same as before, except that we need to flip the `ego` and `alter` columns at the end.** 

There are also some other data cleaning steps that we need to perform: remove self-loops, remove duplicates and keep only reports made by registered reporters. We will do all of that inside a function in the next section, to make it easier to re-use.

# 4. Automating the process

## 4.1. Create a function to get the data for a given village and tie type

This function will also take care of the data cleaning steps that we described in the previous section. Importantly, it will also map the double-sampled tie types to the layer names we will use in VIMuRe.

                                  ),
                                all_na_codes=c("9999999", "5555555", "7777777", "0"),

}

```

## 4.2 Getting an edgelist per layer

Each double-sampled tie type is mapped to a layer in VIMuRe. The mapping can be seen in the function we created above and is also shown below.

```r
ties_layer_mapping = list(borrowmoney = "money",
                          lendmoney = "money",
                          giveadvice = "advice",
                          helpdecision = "advice",
                          keroricego = "kerorice",
                          keroricecome = "kerorice",
                          visitgo = "visit",
                          visitcome = "visit")
```

Therefore, to get the edgelist for, say the `money` layer, we need to combine the `borrowmoney` and `lendmoney` tie types. We can do this by using the `get_karnataka_survey_data` function we created above.

```r

# Get the edgelist for the money layer
output <- get_karnataka_survey_data(village_id = 1, tie_type = "lendmoney", indivinfo = indivinfo)
edgelist_lendmoney <- output$edgelist
reporters          <- output$reporters

edgelist_borrowmoney <- get_karnataka_survey_data(village_id = 1, tie_type = "borrowmoney", indivinfo = indivinfo)$edgelist

edgelist_money <- rbind(edgelist_lendmoney, edgelist_borrowmoney)

```

which now gives us all the edges for the `money` layer:

```r
set.seed(100) # set the random seed for reproducibility

edgelist_money %>% sample_n(size = 10, replace = FALSE)
```         

|    ego|  alter| reporter|tie_type    |layer | weight|
|------:|------:|--------:|:-----------|:-----|------:|
| 111903| 111902|   111902|borrowmoney |money |      1|
| 104901| 104101|   104101|borrowmoney |money |      1|
| 111401| 109701|   109701|borrowmoney |money |      1|
| 118001| 112605|   112605|borrowmoney |money |      1|
| 106205| 106302|   106205|lendmoney   |money |      1|
| 100701| 100801|   100701|lendmoney   |money |      1|
| 111502| 108902|   111502|lendmoney   |money |      1|
| 100501| 100801|   100801|borrowmoney |money |      1|
| 112601| 111903|   111903|borrowmoney |money |      1|
| 117301| 109505|   109505|borrowmoney |money |      1|

**The above is the format we want the data to be in! This format will make it easier to work with `VIMuRe`.** Although, only the `ego`, `alter`, `reporter` columns are required. The `tie_type`, `layer` and `weight` columns are optional, but useful to have.


Use the full pre-processing script below to pre-process all the data for all tie types and save it to a single `vil1_money.csv` file. We also save the `respondents` list to, as a data frame, to a `vil1_money_respondents.csv` file.

[^1]: Note that the authors provide a different version of the network data on Harvard Dataverse [@banerjee_diffusion_2013-1]. However, we will use the raw version provided by Prof. Jackson in this tutorial, as the version of the Dataverse has already had some pre-processing (importantly, they have made the adjacency matrices symmetric), while the version provided by Prof. Jackson gives the original node list. We will use the Harvard Dataverse files just for the metadata.
