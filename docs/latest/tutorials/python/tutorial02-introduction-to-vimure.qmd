# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

**Import packages**

```python
import pandas as pd
import vimure as vm
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure you have installed the latest version of `VIMuRe` before running this tutorial. Follow the üì¶ [Installation instructions](/latest/install.qmd) if you haven't already.

# üì• Step 1: Load the data

Here, we'll use the `VIMuRe` package to model social networks from a village in Karnataka, India, gathered as part of a project studying the adoption of microfinance [@banerjee_diffusion_2013]. The data files we use here are derived from those openly-available on the Harvard Dataverse page [@banerjee_diffusion_2013-1]. See üíª  [Tutorial 1](/latest/tutorials/python/tutorial01-data-preparation.qmd) for more details on how to prepare data for `VIMuRe`.

We have selected a particular village to focus on. The dataset contains information on multiple different types of relationships. We are interested in relationships that were "double-sampled" in the original survey, meaning those elicited through two different prompts. For example, respondents were asked both _"If you needed to borrow kerosene or rice, to whom would you go?"_ as well as _"Who would come to you if he/she needed to borrow kerosene or rice?"_ These two different prompts should give us different perspectives on what could be the same relationship (i.e., we're asking $ego$ if they **go** to $alter$ for help, and also asking $alter$ if $ego$ **comes** to them for help). 

Four different tie types (or "layers") were double-sampled in this way (i.e., elicited with two prompts). Here, we will focus just on one tie type: the "visiting" relationship (based on two prompts: _"In your free time, whose house do you visit?" and "Who visits your house in his or her free time?"_).

## Load Data Frame

After our preprocessing, the input data takes the form of the dataset given below. 

- `ego`: generally the requester, who is also referred to as $i$ in [@de_bacco_latent_2023] (required ‚úîÔ∏è)
- `alter`: generally the giver, also referred to as $j$ in [@de_bacco_latent_2023] (required ‚úîÔ∏è)
- `reporter`: the person reporting on the tie, as referred to as $m$ in [@de_bacco_latent_2023] (required ‚úîÔ∏è)
- `tie_type`: the prompt type that was given (optional)
- `layer`: the tie type (optional)
- `weight`: the weight of the edge (optional)

Suppose we have a data frame `edgelist` of our village's data that looks like this:

```r
edgelist.sample(n=10, random_state=1)
```

|    ego |   alter |   reporter | tie_type    | layer   |   weight |
|-------:|--------:|-----------:|:------------|:--------|---------:|
| 103101 |  103201 |     103201 | borrowmoney | money   |        1 |
| 101201 |  102901 |     102901 | borrowmoney | money   |        1 |
| 111904 |  112602 |     111904 | lendmoney   | money   |        1 |
| 113201 |  104001 |     104001 | borrowmoney | money   |        1 |
| 101303 |  115704 |     101303 | lendmoney   | money   |        1 |
| 112901 |  113601 |     113601 | borrowmoney | money   |        1 |
| 104801 |  104901 |     104901 | borrowmoney | money   |        1 |
| 108803 |  107503 |     108803 | lendmoney   | money   |        1 |
| 102901 |  103701 |     103701 | borrowmoney | money   |        1 |
| 117202 |  115504 |     117202 | lendmoney   | money   |        1 |

: A typical data input for `VIMuRe`

## Load `igraph` object

Alternatively, you might have your data as a **directed** `igraph` object. In this case, you must ensure that the `igraph` object has the following attributes:

- `reporter`: the person reporting on the tie, as referred to as $m$ in [@de_bacco_latent_2023] (required ‚úîÔ∏è)
- `tie_type`: the prompt type that was given (optional)
- `layer`: the tie type (optional)
- `weight`: the weight of the edge (optional)

Note that the igraph function assumes that the first two columns in the data frame comprise the edge list (i.e., the $ego$ and $alter$ columns and treat all subsequent columns as edge attributes). 

```python
import igraph as ig

G = ig.Graph.DataFrame(edgelist, directed=True, use_vids=False)
```

Suppose our village's data is in the form of an `igraph` object `G`:

```python
print(G.summary())
```

which gives us the following output:

```python
IGRAPH DNW- 324 624 -- 
+ attr: name (v), layer (e), reporter (e), tie_type (e), weight (e)
```

# üìä Step 2: Summary statistics

Let's take a closer look at how many nodes and edges we have in our data. We can also look at how many reporters we have in our data.

## Number of nodes and edges

::: panel-tabset

## Data Frame

```python
unique_nodes = pd.concat([edgelist['ego'], edgelist['alter']]).unique()

print(f"Number of nodes: {len(unique_nodes)}")
print(f"Number of edges: {len(edgelist)}")
```

which yields:

```text
Number of nodes: 324
Number of edges: 624
```

## `igraph` object

```python
print(f"Number of nodes: {G.vcount()}")
print(f"Number of edges: {G.ecount()}")
```

which yields:

```text
Number of nodes: 324
Number of edges: 625
```
:::

## Number of reporters

::: panel-tabset

## Data Frame

```r
reporters = edgelist["reporter"].unique()
print(f"Number of reporters: {len(reporters)}")
```

```text
Number of reporters: 191
```

## `igraph` object

```r
reporters = set(g.es["reporter"])
print(f"Number of reporters: {len(reporters)}")
```

```text
Number of reporters:  191 
```

:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

When running VIMuRe, if you do not inform the full list of reporters, VIMuRe will implicitly assume that only reporters who appeared in the `reporter` column (or in the igraph's edge attribute of the same name) were interviewed. That is, if you just pass the data frame or `igraph` object as above, VIMuRe will assume that there were 191 reporters.

However, if you followed üíª [Tutorial 01](/latest/tutorials/python/tutorial01-data-preparation.qmd), you might notice that at the end, you have 12 more reporters:

```r
# After running:
edgelist, reporters <- get_layer(...)

len(reporters)
```

```text
203
```

If these twelve additional reporters are present in the data as either ego or alter nodes in the network, you can inform VIMuRe about them. However, if they are not included in either of these columns, an error will occur. Our current implementation does not support "external reporters" yet. If this is a feature you would like to see sonner, let us know by adding a [discussion](https://github.com/latentnetworks/vimure/discussions) on GitHub.

## Average number of ties per reporter

There are a couple of things to note about this dataset: the maximum number of name generators is four, and reporters can only report on ties that they are a part of (e.g., if a reporter is not a part of a tie, they cannot report on it). Because we are modeling double-sampled questions, each reporter can report a maximum of 8 ties.

Let's create a plot to visualise the distribution of the number of ties per reporter:

::: panel-tabset

## Data Frame

```python
# Create a plot_df to summarise the number of ties per reporter

plot_df = (
    edgelist.groupby(['tie_type', 'reporter'])
    .size()
    .reset_index(name='n_ties')
    .groupby(['n_ties', 'tie_type'])
    .size()
    .reset_index(name='n_reporters')
    .sort_values(['n_ties', 'tie_type'])
)
```

## `igraph` object

```python
# Create a plot_df to summarise the number of ties per reporter

plot_df = (
    pd.DataFrame({attr: G.es[attr] for attr in ["reporter", "tie_type"]})
    .groupby("reporter")
    .apply(lambda x: x["tie_type"].value_counts())
    .reset_index(name="n_ties")
    .rename(columns={"level_1": "tie_type"})
    .groupby(["n_ties", "tie_type"])
    .size()
    .reset_index(name="n_reporters")
    .sort_values(["n_ties", "tie_type"])
)
```

producing the following table:

::: {style="width:50%"}

|   n_ties | tie_type    |   n_reporters |
|---------:|:------------|--------------:|
|        1 | borrowmoney |            57 |
|        1 | lendmoney   |            66 |
|        2 | borrowmoney |            92 |
|        2 | lendmoney   |            86 |
|        3 | borrowmoney |            31 |
|        3 | lendmoney   |            16 |
|        4 | borrowmoney |             1 |

## Union vs. Intersection and the concept of Concordance

Concordance is the proportion of the ties in the network that both reporters report. It measures the extent to which the two reporters agree about the network [@ready_measuring_2021]. It is calculated as follows:


$$
\text{Concordance} = \frac{\text{\# of ties reported by both reporters}}{\text{\# number of unique ties reported}} 
$$

::: panel-tabset

## Data Frame

```python
# Take the intersection: keep only records where 
# both reporters report on the same tie in both tie_types
df_intersection = (
    edgelist.groupby(['ego', 'alter'], dropna=False)
    .filter(lambda x: len(x) == 2)
    .loc[:, ['ego', 'alter']]
    .drop_duplicates()
)

# Take the union: keep all ties reported 
# irrespective of tie_type and how many times they were reported
df_union = edgelist.loc[:, ['ego', 'alter']].drop_duplicates()

# Concordance
concordance = len(df_intersection) / len(df_union)
print(f"Concordance is: {concordance}")
```

## `igraph` object

```python
# Take the intersection: keep only records where 
# both reporters report on the same tie in both tie_types
which_edges_intersection = [e for e in G.es if G.count_multiple(e) == 2]

G_intersection = G.subgraph_edges(which_edges_intersection)
G_intersection = G_intersection.simplify()

# Take the union: keep all ties reported 
# irrespective of tie_type and how many times they were reported
G_union = G.simplify()

# Concordance
print("Concordance is:", G_intersection.ecount() / G_union.ecount())
```

:::

producing:

```text
Concordance is: 0.014634146341463415
```

# üì¶ Step 3: Use `vimure` package to run the model

If you have already prepared your data (See üíª [Tutorial 01](/latest/tutorials/python/tutorial01-data-preparation.qmd)), you can use the `vimure` package to run the model directly on your data.

::: panel-tabset

## Data Frame

```python
import vimure as vm

# Run the model
model = vm.model.VimureModel()
model.fit(edgelist)
```

## `igraph` object

```python
import vimure as vm

# Run the model
model = vm.model.VimureModel()
model.fit(g)
```

:::

After which, you might be interested to look at the posterior estimates of the model parameters:

```python
# Returns a dictionary with the posterior estimates of the model parameters
posterior_estimates = model.get_posterior_estimates()

# Check which parameters were estimated
posterior_estimates.keys()
```

```text
dict_keys(['rho', 'theta', 'lambda', 'nu'])
```

We will look at what these mean in the next section.

## Posteriors

The four values you get from the `get_posterior_estimates()` method are the [geometric expectations](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DMxe4XKXnjyMEAAGw/the-geometric-expectation) of the distributions of the following parameters:

| Parameter | Symbol | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `rho` | $\rho_{lijk}$ | The probability that a directed tie of weight $k-1$ exists between nodes $i$ and $j$ on a particular layer $l$|
| `theta` | $\theta_{lm}$ | The "reliability" of a reporter $m$ on layer $l$|
| `lambda` | $\lambda_{lk}$ | The latent contribution that $Y_l=k$ has on $\theta_{lm}$ |
| `nu` | $\nu$ | The inferred mutuality for the network (latent equivalent to $\eta$)|

: {tbl-colwidths="[10,10,80]"}

Remember that the expected value of our model is:

$$
\mathbb{E} \left[X_{lijm}^{}|Y_{lij}^{} = k\right] = \theta_{lm}\lambda_{lk}^{}+\eta X_{ljim}^{}
$$

## Implicit assumptions

The first think you might have noticed when you ran `model.fit()` were the warning messages:

> ```UserWarning: The set of nodes was not informed, using ego and alter columns to infer nodes.```
>
> ```UserWarning: The set of reporters was not informed, assuming set(reporters) = set(nodes) and N = M.```
>
> ```UserWarning: Reporters Mask was not informed (parameter R). Parser will build it from reporter column, assuming a reporter can only report their own ties.```

The messages are not errors; they are simply indications that the VIMuRe package has made some implicit assumptions when loading the data.  If you would like to set the nodes, reporters, and reporter mask explicitly, you can pass these values as arguments to the fit() method. For example:

```python
model.fit(edgelist, 
          nodes=all_nodes, 
          reporters=all_reporters, 
          R=reporter_mask)
```

## A note on the reporter mask (`R`)

While nodes and reporters are simple lists of strings, the reporter mask `R` is a multidimensional sparse logical array (a tensor) with dimensions $L \times N \times N \times N$. Here, `R[l, i, j, m]` indicates that reporter $m$ can report on the tie between $i$ and $j$ if the tie is belongs to layer $l$. 

So, for example, if the survey design was such that reporters could only report on ties involving themselves, this implies in:

\begin{cases}

R_{lijm} = 1 & \text{if } i = m \text{ or } j = m \\
R_{lijm} = 0 & \text{otherwise}.

\end{cases}


It's worth noting that the last dimension is $N$ instead of $M$. This is because the current implementation of the code assumes that all reporters are part of the network. The mathematical model, as described in [@de_bacco_latent_2023], is more flexible and supports an arbitrary set of reporters, whether they are a subset of nodes or not. However, we have not yet implemented this functionality in the code. Our survey designs have so far assumed that all reporters are part of the network, so this has not been a problem. If this is a feature you would like to see sonner, let us know by adding a [discussion](https://github.com/latentnetworks/vimure/discussions) on GitHub.
