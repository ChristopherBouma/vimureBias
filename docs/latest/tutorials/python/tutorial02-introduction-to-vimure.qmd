# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

**Import packages**

```python
import pandas as pd
import vimure as vm
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure you have installed the latest version of `VIMuRe` before running this tutorial. Follow the üì¶ [Installation instructions](/latest/install.qmd) if you haven't already.

# üì• Step 1: Load the data

Here, we'll use the `VIMuRe` package to model social networks from a village in Karnataka, India, gathered as part of a project studying the adoption of microfinance [@banerjee_diffusion_2013]. The data files we use here are derived from those openly-available on the Harvard Dataverse page [@banerjee_diffusion_2013-1]. See üíª  [Tutorial 1](/latest/tutorials/python/tutorial01-data-preparation.qmd) for more details on how to prepare data for `VIMuRe`.

We have selected a particular village to focus on. The dataset contains information on multiple different types of relationships. We are interested in relationships that were "double-sampled" in the original survey, meaning those elicited through two different prompts. For example, respondents were asked both _"If you needed to borrow kerosene or rice, to whom would you go?"_ as well as _"Who would come to you if he/she needed to borrow kerosene or rice?"_ These two different prompts should give us different perspectives on what could be the same relationship. If everyone in the network is being surveyed, then this should mean that we are eliciting information on a relationship twice (hence, "double sampling"): we're asking `ego` if they go to `alter` for help, and also asking `ego` if `alter` comes to them for help.

Four different tie types (or "layers") were double-sampled in this way (i.e., elicited with two prompts). Here, we will use all four layers to model the latent network structure. The four layers are:

- `money`: money lending and borrowing
- `advice`: advice giving and receiving
- `visit`: visiting and being visited
- `kerorice`: lending and borrowing of household items

We stored all the data in a single data frame, `edgelist`.

<details><summary>Click to see the code we used</summary>

```python
# Here we are using the get_layer() function defined in Tutorial 01

edgelist_money, reporters_money = get_layer(1, "money", get_indivinfo(METADATA_FILE), raw_csv_folder=RAW_CSV_FOLDER)
edgelist_visit, reporters_visit = get_layer(1, "visit", get_indivinfo(METADATA_FILE), raw_csv_folder=RAW_CSV_FOLDER)
edgelist_advice, reporters_advice = get_layer(1, "advice", get_indivinfo(METADATA_FILE), raw_csv_folder=RAW_CSV_FOLDER)
edgelist_kerorice, reporters_kerorice = get_layer(1, "kerorice", get_indivinfo(METADATA_FILE), raw_csv_folder=RAW_CSV_FOLDER)

edgelist = pd.concat([edgelist_money, edgelist_visit, edgelist_advice, edgelist_kerorice])
del edgelist_money, edgelist_visit, edgelist_advice, edgelist_kerorice

reporters = reporters_money.union(reporters_visit).union(reporters_advice).union(reporters_kerorice)
del reporters_money, reporters_visit, reporters_advice, reporters_kerorice

# The code below should help you confirm that all reporters appear in the edgelist:
reporters.difference(set(edgelist.reporter)) # This should return an empty set
```

::: panel-tabset

## Load Data Frame

After our preprocessing, the input data takes the form of the dataset given below. 

- `ego`: generally the requester, who is also referred to as $i$ in [@de_bacco_latent_2023] (required ‚úîÔ∏è)
- `alter`: generally the giver, also referred to as $j$ in [@de_bacco_latent_2023] (required ‚úîÔ∏è)
- `reporter`: the person reporting on the tie, as referred to as $m$ in [@de_bacco_latent_2023] (required ‚úîÔ∏è)
- `tie_type`: the prompt type that was given, e.g., borrow money or lend money (optional)
- `layer`: the relationship type, e.g., money (optional)
- `weight`: the weight of the edge, e.g., the actual amount of money transferred (optional)

Suppose we have a data frame `edgelist` of our village's data that looks like this:

```r
edgelist.sample(n=10, random_state=1)
```

|    ego |   alter |   reporter | tie_type     | layer    |   weight |
|-------:|--------:|-----------:|:-------------|:---------|---------:|
| 107303 |  107307 |     107307 | helpdecision | advice   |        1 |
| 116402 |  115702 |     116402 | keroricecome | kerorice |        1 |
| 103202 |  117301 |     103202 | giveadvice   | advice   |        1 |
| 116201 |  110401 |     116201 | keroricecome | kerorice |        1 |

| 111204 |  110701 |     111204 | lendmoney    | money    |        1 |
| 108304 |  111502 |     108304 | keroricecome | kerorice |        1 |

| 106201 |  116105 |     106201 | keroricecome | kerorice |        1 |

: A typical data input for `VIMuRe`

## Load `igraph` object

Alternatively, you might have your data as a **directed** `igraph` object. In this case, you must ensure that the `igraph` object has the following **edge attributes**:

- `reporter`: the person reporting on the tie, as referred to as $m$ in [@de_bacco_latent_2023] (required ‚úîÔ∏è)
- `tie_type`: the prompt type that was given (optional)
- `layer`: the tie type (optional)
- `weight`: the weight of the edge (optional)

Note that the `igraph` function assumes that the first two columns in the data frame comprise the edge list (i.e., the $ego$ and $alter$ columns and treat all subsequent columns as edge attributes). 

```python
import igraph as ig

G = ig.Graph.DataFrame(edgelist, directed=True, use_vids=False)
```

Suppose our village's data is in the form of an `igraph` object `G`:

```python
print(G.summary())
```

which gives us the following output:

```python
IGRAPH DNW- 417 2690 -- 
+ attr: name (v), layer (e), reporter (e), tie_type (e), weight (e)
```

# üìä Step 2: Summary statistics

Let's take a closer look at how many nodes and edges we have in our data. We can also look at how many reporters we have in our data.

## 2.1: Number of nodes and edges

::: panel-tabset

## Data Frame

```python
unique_nodes = pd.concat([edgelist['ego'], edgelist['alter']]).unique()

print(f"Number of nodes: {len(unique_nodes)}")
print(f"Number of edges: {len(edgelist)}")
```

which yields:

```text
Number of nodes: 417
Number of edges: 2690
```

## `igraph` object

```python
print(f"Number of nodes: {G.vcount()}")
print(f"Number of edges: {G.ecount()}")
```

which yields:

```text
Number of nodes: 417
Number of edges: 2690
```
:::

## 2.2: Number of reporters

::: panel-tabset

## Data Frame

```r
reporters = edgelist["reporter"].unique()
print(f"Number of reporters: {len(reporters)}")
```

```text
Number of reporters: 203
```

## `igraph` object

```r
reporters = set(G.es["reporter"])
print(f"Number of reporters: {len(reporters)}")
```

```text
Number of reporters:  203 
```

:::


## 2.3: Average number of ties per reporter

There are a couple of things to note about this dataset: reporters could name a maximum of four alters for each question, and reporters can only report on ties that they are a part of (e.g., if a reporter is not part of a tie, they cannot report on it). Because we are modelling double-sampled questions, each reporter can report a maximum of 8 ties.

Let's create a plot to visualise the distribution of the number of ties per reporter:

::: panel-tabset

## Data Frame

```python
# Create a plot_df to summarise the number of ties per reporter

plot_df = (
    edgelist.groupby(['layer', 'tie_type', 'reporter'])
    .size()
    .reset_index(name='n_ties')
    .groupby(['n_ties', 'tie_type', 'layer'])
    .size()
    .reset_index(name='n_reporters')
    .sort_values(["layer",  "n_ties", "tie_type"])
)
```

## `igraph` object

```python
# Create a plot_df to summarise the number of ties per reporter

plot_df = (
    pd.DataFrame({attr: G.es[attr] for attr in ["reporter", "tie_type", "layer"]})
    .groupby(["reporter", "layer"])
    .apply(lambda x: x["tie_type"].value_counts())
    .reset_index(name="n_ties")
    .rename(columns={"level_2": "tie_type"})
    .groupby(["n_ties", "tie_type", "layer"])
    .size()
    .reset_index(name="n_reporters")
    .sort_values(["layer",  "n_ties", "tie_type"])
)
```

## Important

Note that the plot above only represents the reports made by the 203 nodes that appear in the `reporter` column. Given that the total number of nodes in the network is 417, either some nodes did not report on any ties, or they were not interviewed at all. 

VIMuRe will consider all nodes in the network, even if they are not present in the `reporter` column. If you want to restrict your analysis to include only the network of reporters, you must filter the edge list before proceeding.

:::

## 2.4: Union vs. Intersection and the concept of Concordance

Concordance is the proportion of the ties in the network that both reporters report. It measures the extent to which the two reporters agree about the tie (see [@ready_measuring_2021] for a discussion of concordance in the Karnataka network data). It is calculated as follows:


$$
\text{Concordance} = \frac{\text{\# of ties reported by both reporters}}{\text{\# number of unique ties reported}} 
$$

::: panel-tabset

## Data Frame

```python
# Take the intersection: keep only records where 
# both reporters report on the same tie in both tie_types
df_intersection = (
    edgelist.groupby(['ego', 'alter'], dropna=False)
    .filter(lambda x: len(x) == 2)
    .loc[:, ['ego', 'alter']]
    .drop_duplicates()
)

# Take the union: keep all ties reported 
# irrespective of tie_type and how many times they were reported
df_union = edgelist.loc[:, ['ego', 'alter']].drop_duplicates()

# Concordance
concordance = len(df_intersection) / len(df_union)
print(f"Concordance is: {concordance}")
```

## `igraph` object

```python
# Take the intersection: keep only records where 
# both reporters report on the same tie in both tie_types
which_edges_intersection = [e for e in G.es if G.count_multiple(e) == 2]

G_intersection = G.subgraph_edges(which_edges_intersection)
G_intersection = G_intersection.simplify()

# Take the union: keep all ties reported 
# irrespective of tie_type and how many times they were reported
G_union = G.simplify()

# Concordance
print("Concordance is:", G_intersection.ecount() / G_union.ecount())
```

:::

producing:

```text
Concordance is: 0.014634146341463415
```

# üì¶ Step 3: Use `vimure` package to run the model

Now that you have prepared your data, you can use `vimure` to run the model:

::: panel-tabset

## Data Frame

```python
import vimure as vm

# Run the model
model = vm.model.VimureModel()
model.fit(edgelist)
```

## `igraph` object

```python
import vimure as vm

# Run the model
model = vm.model.VimureModel()
model.fit(g)
```

:::

After which, you might be interested to look at the posterior estimates of the model parameters:

```python
# Returns a dictionary with the posterior estimates of the model parameters
posterior_estimates = model.get_posterior_estimates()

# Check which parameters were estimated
posterior_estimates.keys()
```

```text
dict_keys(['nu', 'theta', 'lambda', 'rho'])
```

We will look at what these mean in the next section.

## 3.1: Posterior Estimates

The four values you get from the `get_posterior_estimates()` method are the [geometric expectations](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DMxe4XKXnjyMEAAGw/the-geometric-expectation) of the distributions of the following parameters:

| Parameter | Symbol       | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `nu`      | $\nu$          | The inferred **mutuality** for the network (latent equivalent to $\eta$)|
| `theta`   | $\theta_{lm}$  | The "reliability" of a reporter $m$ on layer $l$|
| `lambda`  | $\lambda_{lk}$ | The latent contribution that $Y_l=k$ has on $\theta_{lm}$, where $k \in \{1, \ldots, K\}$ represents the weight of the tie. |
| `rho`     | $\rho_{lijk}$  | The probability that a directed tie of weight $k-1$ exists between nodes $i$ and $j$ on a particular layer $l$|

: {tbl-colwidths="[10,10,80]"}

Remember that the expected value of our model is:

$$
\mathbb{E} \left[X_{lijm}^{}|Y_{lij}^{} = k\right] = \theta_{lm}\lambda_{lk}^{}+\eta X_{ljim}^{}
$$

where $X_{lijm}^{}$ is the observed value of the tie between nodes $i$ and $j$ reported by reporter $m$ on layer $l$ and $Y_{lij}^{}$ is the "ground truth" of the strength of the directed tie between nodes $i$ and $j$ on layer $l$.

In the subsections below, we will provide an explanation of $\nu$ and $\theta_{lm}$ parameters and how to reason about the mutuality and "reliability" of reporters. $\rho$ and $\lambda$ are more technical and we will go into detail about them in a future tutorial. 

**A quick note about $\rho$**

If you want to extract a quick point estimate of the inferred network, you can simply take the expected value of $\rho$ for $k=1$:

```python
# Expected value of rho for k=1
rho = posterior_estimates['rho'][0,:,:,1]
```

The code above will return a $N \times N$ weighted adjacency matrix which can be thought of as the probability of a tie between individuals $i$ and $j$ on layer $l = 0$ (). More on that in the next tutorial.

Now let's look at parameters $\nu$ and $\theta_{lm}$:

### 3.1.1: Mutuality ($\nu$ or $\eta$)

In our case study:

```python
posterior_estimates['nu']
```

```text
0.6177802251078235
```

This indicates a large mutuality in the network. That is, if $i$ reports that $j$ comes to them for money, then $j$ is likely to report that $i$ comes to them as well.

This is a network-wide parameter and encompasses all layers. If you have reasons to believe mutuality varies across layers, you have to re-run the model for each layer separately.

### 3.1.2: Reliability ($\theta_{lm}$)

First, let's look at the shape of the array:

```python
posterior_estimates['theta'].shape
```

```text
(4, 417)
```

We only have one layer, so the first dimension is 1. The second dimension is the number of reporters in the network. In our case, this shows that there are 417 reporters in the network. 

::: { .callout-note collapse="true"}

## Another note on the number of reporters

You might be wondering why there are so many reporters. After all, in Section [2.2: Number of reporters](#number-of-reporters), we calculated this number to be around 200! This is due to a technicality in the way the VIMuRe package handles the data. Our current implementation represents the total number of reporters, $M$ as $M = N$ (i.e. the number of nodes is equal to the number of reporters). 

This is akin to saying each node has _the potential_ to be a reporter. But to control for which nodes are actually reporters, we use a binary mask, $R_{lijm}$, which is 1 if the node $m$ is a reporter on layer $l$ for the tie between nodes $i$ and $j$ and 0 otherwise. You can control how this mask is built by passing the `R` parameter to the `fit()` method. Read more about it in section [3.3: A note on the reporter mask (`R`)](#a-note-on-the-reporter-mask-r).

Changing this is a priority for the next version of the package. But, as it is not a trivial change, we have decided to leave it as it is for now.

:::

**Ranking the reporters**

Let's check which reporters have the highest $\theta$ values:

<details><summary>Click to see the code</summary>

```python
# Get the node mapping: which node corresponds to which index in the array
df_nodes = model.nodeNames

# Which nodes are reporters?
# Note: this assumes you have a `reporters` list from Tutorial 01
# TODO: Check that the number of reporters is consistent
id_reporters = df_nodes[df_nodes['name'].isin(reporters)]["id"].values

# Get the reliability estimates for the reporters
df_theta_reporters = pd.DataFrame({
    "reporter_id": id_reporters,
    "reporter_name": df_nodes.iloc[id_reporters]["name"].values,
    "theta": posterior_estimates['theta'][0, id_reporters]
})

# Sort by reliability
df_theta_reporters.sort_values(by="theta", ascending=False, inplace=True)

df_theta_reporters.head()
```
</details>

::: {style="width: 50%;"}

|   reporter_id |   reporter_name |   theta |
|--------------:|----------------:|--------:|
|           120 |          113302 | 1.56319 |
|           124 |          113901 | 1.53006 |
|            97 |          109902 | 1.48193 |
|            92 |          109505 | 1.4819  |
|            56 |          105902 | 1.48187 |

:::

**How should we interpret the values?**

The interpretation depends on both the mutuality of the network and the survey design. If the mutuality is high (as indicated by $\nu$ being closer to 1), reporters will tend to reciprocate the ties they report by default, and reporters with high $\theta$ values (relative to the $\theta$ distribution) are likely "over-reporting" ties.

To verify if this is the case for the network, let's examine the top reporter listed in the table above (113302).

```python
edgelist[edgelist["reporter"] == "113302"]
```

Reporter `113901` reports that `110201` and `114702` come to them for money and that they go to `112901`, `117301`, and `114101` for money. 

But, we will notice that only 2 of these 5 nodes are reporters:

```python
[x for x in ["110201", "114702", "112901", "117301", "114101"] if x in reporters]
```

```text
['114702', '117301']
```

That is, we cannot confirm these ties with other reporters (people were only asked about ties that involved themselves).

On top of that, when we look at the reports made by the two reporters above, we see that none of them mention `113901`:

```python
edgelist[edgelist["reporter"].isin(["114702", "117301"])]
```

**What is the distribution of $\theta$ values?**

Let's plot the distribution of $\theta$ values for the reporters:

```python

# plotnine is the python equivalent of ggplot2
from plotnine import *

# Plot the distribution of theta values
g = (
    ggplot(df_theta_reporters, aes(x="theta"))
    + geom_histogram(bins=20)
    # Make x labs a greek symbol
    + labs(x=r"$\theta_m$", y="Count",
           title="Distribution of theta values for reporters")
    + theme_bw()
)

ggsave(g, "theta_reporters.png", width=7, height=4, dpi=300)
```

</details>

**What does $\theta \approx 0$ represent in this example?**

The huge peak at $\theta \approx 0$ represents the reporters who are not reporting most ties they are involved in. To make this point clearer, take a look at one of the reporters with $\theta \approx 0$ (117301):

```python
edgelist[edgelist["reporter"] == "117301"]
```

|    ego |   alter |   reporter | tie_type    | layer   |   weight |
|-------:|--------:|-----------:|:------------|:--------|---------:|
| 117301 |  107901 |     117301 | lendmoney   | money   |        1 |
| 117301 |  116001 |     117301 | lendmoney   | money   |        1 |
| 107901 |  117301 |     117301 | borrowmoney | money   |        1 |
| 116001 |  117301 |     117301 | borrowmoney | money   |        1 |

Now, if we search the edgelist, we will see that this node is reported by many other reporters:

```python
edgelist[(
    ((edgelist["ego"] == "117301") | (edgelist["alter"] == "117301")) & 
    (edgelist["reporter"] != "117301"))].sort_values(["reporter"])
```

To avoid making inaccurate assumptions, it's important to refrain from categorically stating that a reporter with $\theta_m = 0$ is "under-reporting" ties. This is because the survey design can also impact how we interpret the results. For instance, in the Karnataka study, reporters could only report a maximum of four ties per prompt. Therefore, in some cases, $\theta_m = 0$ might simply indicate that the reporter has reported all their available ties or named all those that they see as salient, rather than deliberately withholding information.

**What does $\theta \approx 1$ represent in this example?**

There is a peak around $\theta \approx 1$, let's investigate what this means:

```python
df_theta_reporters[(
    (df_theta_reporters["theta"] <= 1.05) & 
    (df_theta_reporters["theta"] >= 0.95))]
```

As an example, let's look at the reports made by `114802`:

```python
edgelist[edgelist["reporter"] == "114802"]
```

::: {style="width: 50%;"}

|    ego |   alter |   reporter | tie_type    | layer   |   weight |

| 110202 |  114802 |     114802 | borrowmoney | money   |        1 |

:::

Amongst the nodes reported, only `110502` is a reporter and it does not report any ties with `114802` (run `edgelist[edgelist["reporter"] == "110502"]` to verify this).

Besides, another node (`113401`) reports ties with `114802`, but `114802` does not acknowledge any of these ties:

```python
edgelist[(
    (edgelist["ego"] == "114802") | (edgelist["alter"] == "114802")) & 
    (edgelist["reporter"] != "114802")].sort_values(["reporter"])
```

| 114802 |  113401 |     113401 | borrowmoney | money   |        1 |

:::

Bear in mind that this other node (`113401`) has $\theta=0.000019$ and has not reported on several other ties. Which reporter is the most reliable? It is hard to say without knowing more about the survey design.

## 3.2: Implicit assumptions

You might have noticed the following warning messages when you ran `model.fit()`:

> ```UserWarning: The set of nodes was not informed, using ego and alter columns to infer nodes.```
>
> ```UserWarning: The set of reporters was not informed, assuming set(reporters) = set(nodes) and N = M.```
>
> ```UserWarning: Reporters Mask was not informed (parameter R). Parser will build it from reporter column, assuming a reporter can only report their own ties.```

The messages are not errors; they are simply indications that the VIMuRe package has made some implicit assumptions when loading the data.  If you would like to set the nodes, reporters, and reporter mask _explicitly_, you can pass these values as arguments to the fit() method. For example:

```python
model.fit(edgelist, 
          nodes=all_nodes, 
          reporters=all_reporters, 
          R=reporter_mask)
```

## 3.3: A note on the reporter mask (`R`)

While nodes and reporters are simple lists of strings, the reporter mask `R` is a multidimensional sparse logical array (a tensor) with dimensions $L \times N \times N \times N$. Here, `R[l, i, j, m]` indicates that reporter $m$ can report on the tie between $i$ and $j$ if the tie belongs to layer $l$. 

So, for example, if the survey design was such that reporters could only report on ties involving themselves, this implies:

\begin{cases}

R_{lijm} = 1 & \text{if } i = m \text{ or } j = m \\
R_{lijm} = 0 & \text{otherwise}.

\end{cases}

Depending on your survey design, you might want to construct `R` manually. For example, if all reporters were asked about all ties ‚Äì regardless of whether they were involved in the ties or not ‚Äì then `R` would be a multi-dimensional array of ones. We are planning a future tutorial on how to handle different survey designs.


It's worth noting that currently, the last dimension has size $N$ instead of $M$. This is because the current implementation of the code assumes that all reporters are part of the network. The mathematical model, as described in [@de_bacco_latent_2023], is more flexible and supports an arbitrary set of reporters, whether they are a subset of nodes or not. However, we have not yet implemented this functionality in the code. Our survey designs have so far assumed that all reporters are part of the network, so this has not been a problem. If this is a feature you would like to see sooner, let us know by adding a [discussion](https://github.com/latentnetworks/vimure/discussions) on GitHub.
