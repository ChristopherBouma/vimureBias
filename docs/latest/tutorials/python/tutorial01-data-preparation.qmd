TLDR: By the end of this tutorial, you should produce a data frame in the following format:

| respondent|      i|      j|tie_type     | weight|
|----------:|------:|------:|:------------|------:|
|     100201| 107603| 100201|borrowmoney  |      1|
|     100202| 100201| 100202|borrowmoney  |      1|
|     100601| 101901| 100601|borrowmoney  |      1|
|     100601| 102601| 100601|borrowmoney  |      1|
|     100601| 115501| 100601|borrowmoney  |      1|
|     100602| 100501| 100602|borrowmoney  |      1|

# Introduction

Before you start using `VIMuRe`, you need to prepare your data in a specific format. This tutorial will show you how to do that. 

Here, we will illustrate the process of preparing data for the `VIMuRe` package using the **"Data on Social Networks and Microfinance in Indian Villages"** dataset [@banerjee_diffusion_2013]. This dataset contains network data on 75 villages in the Karnataka state of India. 

**⚙️ Setup**

We will rely on the following packages in this tutorial:

```python
import os

import pandas as pd
```

# Step 1: Download edgelist

Follow the steps below to download the data.

1. Click on [https://www.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/IndianVillagesDataFiles.zip) to download the dataset from Prof. [Matthew O. Jackson's website](https://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/) [^1]. This will download a file called `IndianVillagesDataFiles.zip` in your working directory.
2. Unzip the file. This will create a folder called `2010-0760_Data` in your working directory.
💡 Tip: you can use the `unzip()` function from within R to unzip the file.

The folder structure should look like this:

![](/figures/tutorials/jackson_download_zipfile.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of how folder structure should look like."}

The data we need is within that `Data/Raw_csv/` folder, and looks like this:

![](/figures/tutorials/karnataka_raw_csvs.png)

# Step 2: Collect individual-level metadata

We also need individual-level information metadata. This data is available on a separate source, the Harvard Dataverse [@banerjee_diffusion_2013-1].

1. Go to [https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=2460959&version=9.4](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=2460959&version=9.4), read and accept the "License/Data Use Agreement" to gain access to the data. We are using version 9.4 of the dataset.
2. Click on the "Access File" button, then "Download | ZIP Archive" to download the data.

> ![](/figures/tutorials/dataverse_harvard_download_zipfile.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of how to download data from Harvard Dataverse."}

3. Unzip the file. This will create a folder called `datav4.0.zip` in your working directory.

The data we need is within that `datav4.0/Data/2. Demographics and Outcomes/` folder.

4. Read the data into Python using the `pd.read_stata()` function from pandas:

```python
indivinfo = pd.read_stata("datav4.0/Data/2. Demographics and Outcomes/individual_characteristics.dta")
indivinfo.drop_duplicates(subset=["pid"], inplace=True) ## one individual (6109803) is repeated twice.
```

5. Ensure that the `pid` is a string (we will need this later):


```python
indivinfo["pid"] = indivinfo["pid"].astype(str)
indivinfo["hhid"] = indivinfo["hhid"].astype(str)
```

# Step 3: Build an edge list per village

We will now build the edge list for each village. We will illustrate the process for village 1, but if you scroll down you will find the full script for all villages.

## 3.1. Read metadata

Let's first subset the individual-level metadata to keep only the relevant village:

```python
    # Keep track of where the edgelist files are stored
    RAW_CSV_FOLDER = "2010-0760_Data/Data/Raw_csv"

    # Let's focus on just one village for now
    selected_village = 1

    # Filter the individual-level metadata to keep only the relevant village
    resp = indivinfo[indivinfo["village"] == 1].copy()
    resp["didsurv"] = 1
```

## 3.2. Read village data

Now, let's read the `village_1.csv` file and merge it with the individual-level metadata:

```python
  village_file = os.path.join(RAW_CSV_FOLDER, f"village{selected_village}.csv")
  indiv = pd.read_csv(village_file, header = None, names=["hhid", "ppid", "gender", "age"])

  ## gender (1-Male, 2-Female)
  indiv["gender"] = indiv["gender"].map({1: "Male", 2: "Female"})

  ## pre-process pid to match the format in the individual-level metadata
  indiv["ppid"] = indiv["ppid"].astype(str)
  indiv["hhid"] = indiv["hhid"].astype(str)
  indiv["pid"] =  indiv.apply(lambda x: f'{x["hhid"]}{0 if len(x["ppid"]) != 2 else None}{x["ppid"]}', axis=1)

  ## Select only the relevant columns
  selected_cols = ["pid", "resp_status", "religion", "caste", "didsurv"]
  indiv = pd.merge(indiv, resp[selected_cols], on="pid", how="left")
```

Which produces a dataframe that looks like this:

```r
indiv.head()
```

|    |   hhid |   ppid | gender   |   age |    pid | resp_status       | religion   | caste   |   didsurv |
|---:|-------:|-------:|:---------|------:|-------:|:------------------|:-----------|:--------|----------:|
|  0 |   1001 |      1 | Male     |    75 | 100101 | nan               | nan        | nan     |       nan |
|  1 |   1001 |      2 | Female   |    55 | 100102 | nan               | nan        | nan     |       nan |
|  2 |   1001 |      3 | Male     |    24 | 100103 | nan               | nan        | nan     |       nan |
|  3 |   1001 |      4 | Female   |    19 | 100104 | nan               | nan        | nan     |       nan |
|  4 |   1002 |      1 | Male     |    38 | 100201 | Head of Household | HINDUISM   | OBC     |         1 |

## 3.3 Read reports per relationship type

The survey that produced this data collected information on a number of different types of relationships, four of which were "double sampled" (i.e., asked about in two ways, who people **go** to for that type of support, and who **comes** to them). Specifically, they asked about borrowing and receiving money, giving and receiving advice, borrowing and lending household items like kerosene and rice, and visiting and receiving guests. These distinct questions are represented in the data files with the following names:

- borrowmoney,
- receivemoney,
- helpdecision,
- receiveadvice,
- keroricego,
- keroricecome,
- visitgo,
- visitcome

Each of these relationships is stored in a separate file. For example, the file `borrowmoney1.csv` contains information on who reported borrowing money from whom in village 1.

We can read each of these files using the `pd.read_csv()` function. For example:

```python
filepath_borrowmoney = os.path.join(RAW_CSV_FOLDER, f"borrowmoney{selected_village}.csv")
borrowmoney = pd.read_csv(filepath_borrowmoney, header=None, na_values=ALL_NA_CODES, dtype=str)
```

The `ALL_NA_CODES` variable is a vector of all the codes that, after inspection, we identified were used to represent missing values in the data:

```python
ALL_NA_CODES = ["9999999", "5555555", "7777777", "0"]
```

**What the data looks like**

The data is stored here as a node list, but it will need to be further pre-processed as an edge list:

|    |      0 |      1 |      2 |      3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |
|---:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|
|  0 | 100201 | 107603 |    nan |    nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan |
|  1 | 100202 | 100201 |    nan |    nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan |
|  2 | 100601 | 101901 | 102601 | 115501 | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan |
|  3 | 100602 | 100501 | 101902 |    nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan |
|  4 | 100701 | 100801 | 102101 |    nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan |
|  5 | 100702 | 100801 | 104001 |    nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan |

Each row represents reports made by a single individual; the first number is the `pid` (the "person identifier") of the individual who reported the relationship, whereas the remaining however many numbers listed in the same row are the `pid`s of the individuals who were reported to be involved in the relationship.

## 3.4. Pre-process the data to build the edge list

We want the network data to be in the following format, plus a few additional columns:

|     i |  j    |
|------:|------:|
| 100201| 107603|
| 100202| 100201|
| 100601| 101901|
| 100601| 102601|
| 100601| 115501|
| 100602| 100501|
| 100602| 101902|
| 100701| 100801|
| 100701| 102101|
| 100702| 100801|

To achieve this, we will need to [pivot](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/reshaping.html#pivot-tables) the data.

```python
tie_type = "borrowmoney"

# Example with the borrowmoney data
df = pd.melt(borrowmoney, id_vars=[0]).dropna()
```

This produces a bogus `variable` column, which we can drop. We should also rename the columns to something more meaningful. It is **important** that we add a `respondent` column. This will be the `pid` of the individual who reported the relationship.

```python
df = df.drop(columns="variable")\
       .rename(columns={0: "i", "value": "j"})\
       .assign(respondent=lambda x: x["i"])

# Let's also add a column for the tie type
df = df.assign(tie_type=tie_type)

# Let's add a weight column too
df = df.assign(weight=1)
```

Now, if the question was "Did you borrow money from anyone?", then the `i` column should be the respondent, and the `j` column should be the person who was reported to have borrowed money from the respondent. However, if the question was "Did anyone borrow money from you?", then the `i` column should be the person who was reported to have borrowed money from the respondent, and the `j` column should be the respondent. We can use the `tie_type` variable to determine which of these two scenarios applies.

```python
if tie_type in ["borrowmoney", "keroricego", "visitgo"]:
    df = df.rename(columns={"i": "j", "j": "i"})
```

Let's reorder the columns to guarantee we can `rbind` the data frames of all relationship tipes together later.

```python
df = df[["respondent", "i", "j", "tie_type", "weight"]]
```

which produces the following data frame:

```python
df.head()
```

|    |   respondent |      i |      j | tie_type    |   weight |
|---:|-------------:|-------:|-------:|:------------|---------:|
|  0 |       100201 | 107603 | 100201 | borrowmoney |        1 |
|  1 |       100202 | 100201 | 100202 | borrowmoney |        1 |
|  2 |       100601 | 101901 | 100601 | borrowmoney |        1 |
|  3 |       100602 | 100501 | 100602 | borrowmoney |        1 |
|  4 |       100701 | 100801 | 100701 | borrowmoney |        1 |
|  5 |       100702 | 100801 | 100702 | borrowmoney |        1 |

**The above is the format we want the data to be in! This format will make it easier to work with `VIMuRe`.**

Use the full pre-processing script below to pre-process all the data for all tie types and save it to a single `vil1_edges.csv` file. We also save the `indiv` data frame to a `vil1_meta.csv` file.
